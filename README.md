Do you want to redesign any part of the printer? Here you have the CAD files. Easy as pie.

BCN3D is commited to the global Open Source Project REPRAP. It means you can download all the source files, even the designs of the mechanical pieces that compose the printer. The objective is to get faster and better feedback from the community using our printers. If you detect any error or have any improvements, please let us know by creating an Issue in the GitHub Repository.

You will find folders for the BCN3D+, the dual extruder and pretty soon other upgrades. In each folder there is a BOM (bill of materials), a complete Assembly and the printed parts.

>The fun thing with the STL files is that you can preview the models directly within the browser.
